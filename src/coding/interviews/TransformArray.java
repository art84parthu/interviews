	/**
	 * Given an input array of N elements, 
	 * at a given time all the elements can be either incremented or decremented by 1. 
	 * 
	 * Find minimum number of steps required to transform the array such that
	 * all elements are equal. 
	 * 
	 * [11, 3, 7, 1] (initial array)
	 * [10, 4, 6, 2] (after step 1)
	 * [9, 5, 7, 3] (after step 2)
 	 * [8, 6, 6, 4] (after step 3)
	 * [7, 7, 5, 5] (after step 4)
	 * [6, 6, 6, 6] (after step 5)
	 * 
	 * Some in some arrays it may not be possible.
	 * for example it is not possible with [1,4,7] to equalise elements to one number. 
	 * In Such cases it should return -1
	 * 
	 * Need to find out whats the target value possible and what is the cost - number of steps 
	 * to achieve the target.
